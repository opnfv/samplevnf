Abstract
========

This chapter describes the methodology/overview of SampleVNF project from
the perspective of a :term:`VNF` and verifying the :term:`NFVI`

Overview
========
This project provides a placeholder for various sample VNF (Virtual Network Function (:term:`VNF`))
development which includes example reference architecture and optimization methods
related to VNF/Network service for high performance VNFs.

The sample VNFs are Open Source approximations* of Telco grade :term:`VNF`
using optimized VNF + NFVi Infrastructure libraries, with Performance Characterization of Sample† Traffic Flows.
• * Not a commercial product. Encourage the community to contribute and close the feature gaps.
• † No Vendor/Proprietary Workloads

SampleVNF Test Infrastructure (NSB (Yardstick_NSB_))in yardstick helps to facilitate
consistent/repeatable methodologies for characterizing & validating the
sample VNFs (:term:`VNF`) through OPEN SOURCE VNF approximations.

Network Service Benchmarking in yardstick framework follows ETSI GS NFV-TST001_
to verify/characterize both :term:`NFVI` & :term:`VNF`

The document ETSI GS NFV-TST001_, "Pre-deployment Testing; Report on Validation
of NFV Environments and Services", recommends methods for pre-deployment
testing of the functional components of an NFV environment.

The SampleVNF project implements the methodology described in chapter 13 of Yardstick_NSB_,
"Pre-deployment validation of NFV infrastructure".

The methodology consists in decomposing the typical :term:`VNF` work-load
performance metrics into a number of characteristics/performance vectors, which
each can be represented by distinct test-cases.

Metrics

The metrics, as defined by ETSI GS NFV-TST001, are shown in
:ref:`Table1 <table2_1>`.
