SampleVNF_ is an OPNFV Project.

The project's goal is to provides a placeholder for various sample VNF
(Virtual Network Function (:term:`VNF`)) development which includes example
reference architecture and optimization methods related to VNF/Network service
for high performance VNFs. This project provides benefits to other OPNFV
projects like Functest, Models, yardstick etc to perform real life
use-case based testing and VNF/ Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
(:term:`NFVI`) characterization for the same.

The Project's scope to create a repository of sample VNFs to help VNF
benchmarking and NFVI characterization with real world traffic and host a
common development environment for developing the VNF using optimized libraries.
Also, develop a test framework in yardstick  to enable VNF/NFVI verification.

*SampleVNF* is used in OPNFV for characterization of NFVI/VNF on OPNFV infrastructure
and some of the OPNFV features.
