Automated post installation activities
======================================
Describe specific post installation activities performed by the OPNFV
deployment pipeline including testing activities and reports. Refer to
the relevant testing guides, results, and release notes.

note: this section should be singular and derived from the test projects
once we have one test suite to run for all deploy tools.  This is not the
case yet so each deploy tool will need to provide (hopefully very simillar)
documentation of this.


<Project> post configuration procedures
=======================================
Describe any deploy tool or feature specific scripts, tests or procedures
that should be carried out on the deployment post install and configuration
in this section.


Platform components validation
==============================
Describe any component specific validation procedures necessary for your
deployment tool in this section.
