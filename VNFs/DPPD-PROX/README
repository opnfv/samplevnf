Description
-----------
This is PROX, the Packet pROcessing eXecution engine, part of Intel(R)
Data Plane Performance Demonstrators, and formerly known as DPPD-BNG.
PROX is a DPDK-based application implementing Telco use-cases such as
a simplified BRAS/BNG, light-weight AFTR... It also allows configuring
finer grained network functions like QoS, Routing, load-balancing...

Compiling and running this application
--------------------------------------
This application supports DPDK 16.04, 16.11, 16.11.1, 17.02, 17.05, 17.08, 
17.11, 18.02, 18.05 and 18.08.

The following commands assume that the following variables have been set:

export RTE_SDK=/path/to/dpdk
export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc

IPSec is only supported in PROX starting from DPDK 17.02
It will only be compiled if CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_AESNI_MB is
set in DPDK .config. This also requires AESNI_MULTI_BUFFER_LIB_PATH to point to
the multi-buffer library which can be downloaded from 
<https://github.com/01org/intel-ipsec-mb>. 
See doc/guides/cryptodevs/aesni_mb.rst within dpdk for more details

Example: DPDK 17.05 installation
--------------------------------
git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
cd dpdk
git checkout v17.05
make install T=$RTE_TARGET

PROX compilation
----------------
The Makefile with this application expects RTE_SDK to point to the
root directory of DPDK (e.g. export RTE_SDK=/root/dpdk). If RTE_TARGET
has not been set, x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc will be assumed.

Running PROX
------------
After DPDK has been set up, run make from the directory where you have
extracted this application. A build directory will be created
containing the PROX executable. The usage of the application is shown
below. Note that this application assumes that all required ports have
been bound to the DPDK provided igb_uio driver. Refer to the "Getting
Started Guide - DPDK" document for more details.

Usage: ./build/prox [-f CONFIG_FILE] [-l LOG_FILE] [-p] [-o DISPLAY] [-v] [-a|-e] \
		[-m|-s|-i] [-n] [-w DEF] [-q] [-k] [-d] [-z] [-r VAL] [-u] [-t]
        -f CONFIG_FILE : configuration file to load, ./prox.cfg by default
        -l LOG_FILE : log file name, ./prox.log by default
        -p : include PID in log file name if default log file is used
        -o DISPLAY: Set display to use, can be 'curses' (default), 'cli' or 'none'
        -v verbosity : initial logging verbosity
        -a : autostart all cores (by default)
        -e : don't autostart
        -n : Create NULL devices instead of using PCI devices, useful together with -i
        -m : list supported task modes and exit
        -s : check configuration file syntax and exit
        -i : check initialization sequence and exit
        -u : Listen on UDS /tmp/prox.sock
        -t : Listen on TCP port 8474
        -q : Pass argument to Lua interpreter, useful to define variables
        -w : define variable using syntax varname=value
             takes precedence over variables defined in CONFIG_FILE
        -k : Log statistics to file "stats_dump" in current directory
        -d : Run as daemon, the parent process will block until PROX is not initialized
        -z : Ignore CPU topology, implies -i
        -r : Change initial screen refresh rate. If set to a lower than 0.001 seconds,
                  screen refreshing will be disabled

While applications using DPDK typically rely on the core mask and the
number of channels to be specified on the command line, this
application is configured using a .cfg file. The core mask and number
of channels is derived from this config. For example, to run the
application from the source directory execute:

  user@target:~$ ./build/prox -f ./config/nop.cfg

Provided example configurations
-------------------------------
PROX can be configured either as the SUT (System Under Test) or as the
Traffic Generator. Some example configuration files are provided, both
in the config directory to run PROX as a SUT, and in the gen directory
to run it as a Traffic Generator.
A quick description of these example configurations is provided below.
Additional details are provided in the example configuration files.

Basic configurations, mostly used as sanity check:
- config/nop.cfg
- config/nop-rings.cfg
- gen/nop-gen.cfg

Simplified BNG (Border Network Gateway) configurations, using different
number of ports, with and without QoS, running on the host or in a VM:
- config/bng-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-8ports.cfg
- config/bng-qos-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-qos-8ports.cfg
- config/bng-1q-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-ovs-usv-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-no-cpu-topology-4ports.cfg
- gen/bng-4ports-gen.cfg
- gen/bng-8ports-gen.cfg
- gen/bng-ovs-usv-4ports-gen.cfg

Light-weight AFTR configurations:
- config/lw_aftr.cfg
- gen/lw_aftr-gen.cfg
