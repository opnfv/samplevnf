; This is one of the most basic configurations. Note that this configuration
; does not perform any real work as opposed to configurations like BNG/BRAS
; or lwAFTR. This configuration sets up four interfaces and five cores (one
; master core and four worker cores). Packets are passed (i.e. without being
; touched) as follows:
; - interface 0 to interface 1 (handled by core 1)
; - interface 1 to interface 0 (handled by core 2)
; - interface 2 to interface 3 (handled by core 3)
; - interface 3 to interface 2 (handled by core 4)
