; This configuration is similar to config/nop.cfg with the difference being the
; type of interfaces. The physical ports are replaced by DPDK rings. To use this
; functionality, RTE_TARGET must be set to x86_64-ivshmem-linuxapp-gcc before
; compiling DPDK (i.e. export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-ivshmem-linuxapp-gcc). Also,
; DPDK needs to be compiled with both CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y and
; CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST=y
; The configuration can then be used inside a VM running on top of Open vSwitch.
; The SHA-1 of the Open vSwitch version that has been tested is c78a00b112c9. To
; run the VM, Qemu needs to be patched to support ivshmem with multiple regions
; and the right command line arguments to be used to share memory. Download and
; patch Qemu 1.6.2 using the following commands:
;   git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git
;   cd qemu
;   git checkout v1.6.2
;   wget https://01.org/sites/default/files/page/qemu-v1.6.2-ivshmem-dpdk.patch
;   patch -p1 < qemu-v1.6.2-ivshmem-dpdk.patch
;   ./configure
;   make
; After Open vSwitch has been configured with DPDK rings as ports (i.e. ports
; with type dpdkr), Qemu needs to be started with the correct command line
; arguments. Refer to Section 11.1 from the DPDK Programmer's Guide on how to
; build the Qemu command line arguments.
; This configuration uses 4 ports. This means that 8 rings (4 for TX and 4 for
; RX) will need to be shared with the VM through ivshmem.
