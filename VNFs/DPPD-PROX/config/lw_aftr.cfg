; This configuration creates the functionality of a lwAFTR component of the
; lw4over6 architecture as described in IETF draft available at:
;   http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-softwire-lw4over6-13.txt
; The lwAFTR simply terminates IPv6 tunnels that carry IPv4 traffic for many
; customers (one tunnel per customer). It consists of two tasks:
; 1) ipv6_encap that encapsulates IPv4 packets into IPv6 and sends those tunnel
;    packets towards the customer tunnel endpoint. For this, it must use a
;    binding table that associates with each tunnel, a public IPv4 address and a
;    set of ports.
; 2) ipv6_decap which handles packets arriving from the tunnel, checks they use
;    a source IPv4 address and port combination that matches their originating
;    tunnel (based on the same binding table as used by ipv6_encap), removes the
;    IPv6 encapsulation and sends them out its "internet" interface.
; The binding table must be loaded in the [lua] section and assigned to the
; tasks using the "tun_bindings" parameter. This configuration loads its binding
; table from the provided ip6_tun_bind.lua but other binding tables can be used.
;
; Binding tables of different sizes and different ranges of addresses and ports
; can be generated by a provided helper script:
;   helper-scripts/ipv6_tun/ipv6_tun_bindings.pl -n <num_entries>
; Most other parameters of the generated binding table can be tweaked through
; script command-line switches. For more details, refer to the documentation of
; the script obtained by running it with -help as argument.
; The same script can also generate tables for testing tools to generate packets
; with addresses and ports that match entries from the binding table (randomly
; selecting entries from the binding table).
; Additionally, the helper-scripts/ipv6_tun/gen_4over6.pl script can be used to
; generate pcap files with IPv6 (tunnel) and IPv4 (internet) traffic matching a
; given binding table.
; Example usage:
;   ./helper-scripts/ipv6_tun/ipv6_tun_bindings.pl -n 100000 -suffix _100k
;   ./helper-scripts/ipv6_tun/gen_4over6.pl -tun -count=200000 \
;       -in ip6_tun_bind_100k.lua -out lwAFTR_tun_100k.pcap
;   ./helper-scripts/ipv6_tun/gen_4over6.pl -inet -count=200000 \
;       -in ip6_tun_bind_100k.lua -out lwAFTR_inet_100k.pcap
; The above sequence of invocations generates a binding table with 100k entries,
; written to file ip6_tun_bind_100k.lua (which the PROX configuration file needs
; to load in the [lua] section then assign using the "tun_bindings" parameter),
; and two pcap files to be used to generate traffic that will hit valid entries
; from the binding table. Each pcap file contains 200k packets of either IPv4 or
; IPv6 traffic.
