Glossary
========


ACL
   Access Control List

API
   Application Programming Interface

ASLR
   Linux* kernel Address-Space Layout Randomization

BSD
   Berkeley Software Distribution

Clr
   Clear

CIDR
   Classless Inter-Domain Routing

Control Plane
   The control plane is concerned with the routing of packets and with
   providing a start or end point.

Core
   A core may include several lcores or threads if the processor supports
   hyperthreading.

Core Components
   A set of libraries provided by the DPDK, including eal, ring, mempool,
   mbuf, timers, and so on.

CPU
   Central Processing Unit

CRC
   Cyclic Redundancy Check

ctrlmbuf
   An *mbuf* carrying control data.

Data Plane
   In contrast to the control plane, the data plane in a network architecture
   are the layers involved when forwarding packets.  These layers must be
   highly optimized to achieve good performance.

DIMM
   Dual In-line Memory Module

Doxygen
   A documentation generator used in the DPDK to generate the API reference.

DPDK
   Data Plane Development Kit

DRAM
   Dynamic Random Access Memory

EAL
   The Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) provides a generic interface that
   hides the environment specifics from the applications and libraries.  The
   services expected from the EAL are: development kit loading and launching,
   core affinity/ assignment procedures, system memory allocation/description,
   PCI bus access, inter-partition communication.

FIFO
   First In First Out

FPGA
   Field Programmable Gate Array

GbE
   Gigabit Ethernet

HW
   Hardware

HPET
   High Precision Event Timer; a hardware timer that provides a precise time
   reference on x86 platforms.

ID
   Identifier

IOCTL
   Input/Output Control

I/O
   Input/Output

IP
   Internet Protocol

IPv4
   Internet Protocol version 4

IPv6
   Internet Protocol version 6

lcore
   A logical execution unit of the processor, sometimes called a *hardware
   thread*.

   Layer 2

L3
   Layer 3

L4
   Layer 4

LAN
   Local Area Network

LPM
   Longest Prefix Match

master lcore
   The execution unit that executes the main() function and that launches
   other lcores.

mbuf
   An mbuf is a data structure used internally to carry messages (mainly
   network packets).  The name is derived from BSD stacks.  To understand the
   concepts of packet buffers or mbuf, refer to *TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2:
   The Implementation*.

MESI
   Modified Exclusive Shared Invalid (CPU cache coherency protocol)

MTU
   Maximum Transfer Unit

NIC
   Network Interface Card
