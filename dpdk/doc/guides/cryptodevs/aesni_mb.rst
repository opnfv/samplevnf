AESN-NI Multi Buffer Crytpo Poll Mode Driver
============================================


The AESNI MB PMD (**librte_pmd_aesni_mb**) provides poll mode crypto driver
support for utilizing Intel multi buffer library, see the white paper
`Fast Multi-buffer IPsec Implementations on IntelÂ® Architecture Processors
<https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/intel-technology/fast-multi-buffer-ipsec-implementations-ia-processors-paper.html?wapkw=multi+buffer>`_.

The AES-NI MB PMD has current only been tested on Fedora 21 64-bit with gcc.

Features
--------

AESNI MB PMD has support for:

Cipher algorithms:

* RTE_CRYPTO_SYM_CIPHER_AES128_CBC
* RTE_CRYPTO_SYM_CIPHER_AES256_CBC
* RTE_CRYPTO_SYM_CIPHER_AES512_CBC

Hash algorithms:

* RTE_CRYPTO_SYM_HASH_SHA1_HMAC
* RTE_CRYPTO_SYM_HASH_SHA256_HMAC
* RTE_CRYPTO_SYM_HASH_SHA512_HMAC

Limitations
-----------

* Chained mbufs are not supported.
* Hash only is not supported.
* Cipher only is not supported.
* Only in-place is currently supported (destination address is the same as source address).
* Only supports session-oriented API implementation (session-less APIs are not supported).
*  Not performance tuned.

Installation
------------

To build DPDK with the AESNI_MB_PMD the user is required to download the mult-
buffer library from `here <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/22972>`_
and compile it on their user system before building DPDK. When building the
multi-buffer library it is necessary to have YASM package installed and also
requires the overriding of YASM path when building, as a path is hard coded in
the Makefile of the release package.

.. code-block:: console

	make YASM=/usr/bin/yasm

Initialization
--------------

In order to enable this virtual crypto PMD, user must:

* Export the environmental variable AESNI_MULTI_BUFFER_LIB_PATH with the path where
  the library was extracted.

* Build the multi buffer library (explained in Installation section).

* Set CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_AESNI_MB=y in config/common_base.

To use the PMD in an application, user must:

* Call rte_eal_vdev_init("cryptodev_aesni_mb_pmd") within the application.

* Use --vdev="cryptodev_aesni_mb_pmd" in the EAL options, which will call rte_eal_vdev_init() internally.

The following parameters (all optional) can be provided in the previous two calls:

* socket_id: Specify the socket where the memory for the device is going to be allocated
  (by default, socket_id will be the socket where the core that is creating the PMD is running on).

* max_nb_queue_pairs: Specify the maximum number of queue pairs in the device (8 by default).

* max_nb_sessions: Specify the maximum number of sessions that can be created (2048 by default).

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    ./l2fwd-crypto -c 40 -n 4 --vdev="cryptodev_aesni_mb_pmd,socket_id=1,max_nb_sessions=128"
