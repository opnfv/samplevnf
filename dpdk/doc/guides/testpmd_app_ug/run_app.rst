=======================

EAL Command-line Options
------------------------

The following are the EAL command-line options that can be used in conjunction with the testpmd,
or any other DPDK application.
See the DPDK Getting Started Guides for more information on these options.

*   ``-c COREMASK``

    Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the cores to run on.

*   ``-l CORELIST``

Testpmd Command-line Options
----------------------------

The following are the command-line options for the testpmd applications.
They must be separated from the EAL options, shown in the previous section, with a ``--`` separator:

The commandline options are:

*   ``-i, --interactive``

    Run testpmd in interactive mode.
    In this mode, the testpmd starts with a prompt that can be used to start and stop forwarding,
    configure the application and display stats on the current packet processing session.
    See :ref:`testpmd_runtime` for more details.

    In non-interactive mode,
    the application starts with the configuration specified on the command-line and
    immediately enters forwarding mode.

    Display a help message and quit.

*   ``-a, --auto-start``

    Start forwarding on initialization.

*   ``--nb-cores=N``

    Set the number of forwarding cores,
    where 1 <= N <= "number of cores" or ``CONFIG_RTE_MAX_LCORE`` from the configuration file.

    Set the number of forwarding ports,
    where 1 <= N <= "number of ports" on the board or ``CONFIG_RTE_MAX_ETHPORTS`` from the configuration file.
    The default value is the number of ports on the board.

    Where flag is 1 for RX, 2 for TX, and 3 for RX and TX.

    where 0 <= N < number of sockets on the board.

       ...


*   ``--eth-peer=N,XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX``

    Set the MAC address ``XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`` of the peer port N,
    where 0 <= N < ``CONFIG_RTE_MAX_ETHPORTS`` from the configuration file.
