 * This optimization for A/B is helpful if the divisor B is mostly
 * runtime invariant. The reciprocal of B is calculated in the
 * slow-path with reciprocal_value(). The fast-path can then just use
 * a much faster multiplication operation with a variable dividend A
 * to calculate the division A/B.
