      "message": "I understand that the main goal is to fix a compilation warning. However, this triggers several comments:\n- The terminating null byte is included in the max count of bytes written into the buffer, so sizeof(memzone_name) does not need to be decreased by 1.\n- With the current size of memzone_name at 64, the \"MP_\" prefix and the terminating null byte, at most 60 bytes could be copied from targ-\u003epool_name, rather than the hard-coded 59.\n- In order to automatically adjust to any future size of memzone_name, the precision could be specified as an int argument.\n- See https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html\n\nAs a result, this line could be rewritten as:\nsnprintf(memzone_name, sizeof(memzone_name), \"MP_%.*s\", (int)(sizeof(memzone_name)-4), targ-\u003epool_name);\n\nThat\u0027s rather verbose, I agree ;-)",
