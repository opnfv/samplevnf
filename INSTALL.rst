SAMPLEVNF Installation Guide
============================

Introduction
============
This project provides a placeholder for various sample VNF (Virtual Network
Function)development which includes example reference architecture and
optimization methods related to VNF/Network service for high performance VNFs.

The sample VNFs are Open Source approximations* of Telco grade VNF’s using
optimized VNF + NFVi Infrastructure libraries, with Performance
Characterization of Sample† Traffic Flows.
• * Not a commercial product. Encourage the community to contribute and
    close the feature gaps.
• † No Vendor/Proprietary Workloads 

VNF supported
=============
 1. Carrier Grade Network Address Translation(vCGNAPT) VNF
 2. Firewall (vFW) VNF
 4. Access Control List (vACL) VNF

Please refer docs folder for individual VNF Installation guide.

Note:- Each VNF should include a installation document explain the process to
       install and run VNF.
